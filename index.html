            In social dilemmas, individuals would be better off cooperating but fail to do so due to conflicting interests that discourage cooperation. Existing work on social dilemmas in AI has focused on standard agent design paradigms, most recently in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, with the rise of large language models (LLMs), a new design paradigm for AI systems has started to emerge---generative agents, in which actions performed by agents are chosen by prompting LLMs. This paradigm has seen recent success, such as Voyager, a highly capable Minecraft agent. In this work, we perform an initial study of outcomes that arise when deploying generative agents in social dilemmas. To do this, we build a multi-agent Voyager framework with a contracting and judgement mechanism based on <i>formal contracting</i>, which has been effective in mitigating social dilemmas in MARL. We then construct social dilemmas in Minecraft as the testbed for our open-source framework. Finally, we conduct preliminary experiments using our framework to provide evidence that contracting helps improve outcomes for generative agents in social dilemmas.

    <p>The Multi-Agent Voyager Contracting framework consists of three components: 1) contract negotiation, 2) contract judgement,  and 3) the Voyager iterative prompting mechanism. We modify the original Voyager agent by removing the Automatic Curriculum and Skill Library and introducing components 1 and 2. This framework enables agents to reach contractual agreements and iteratively adapt a policy to maximize reward with self and judge feedback.</p>

            Introducing contracting in Double-Vein allows players to improve on the baseline no-contracting behavior. Both contracts shown are able to reach the socially optimal result by preferentially distributing iron and diamond to the agents who value them highest. The baseline is socially suboptimal because the resource distribution was consistent with selfishly maximizing agents.

              Generated contracts in Cleanup allow players to reach more socially optimal outcomes than baseline. Cleanup-Contract-1 performs best as it enforces full-specialization with no task switching, the most efficient strategy found. On the other hand, Cleanup-Contract-2 enforces specialization with regular task switching. We observe this comes at a cost and achieves less social welfare than Cleanup-Contract-1.

A potential strategy could be to propose a contract where I mine the raw iron and Glitch mines the diamonds.

                            <span style="color: black;">Gizmo (Thought):</span> With the proposed contract, I would mine 12 iron ore which would give me 48 emeralds. Glitch would mine 6 diamonds worth 30 emeralds to them. If I transfer 14 emeralds to Glitch, I would have 34 emeralds and they would have 44 emeralds. This doesn't seem fair to me. I would like to propose a lower emerald transfer to balance things out.<br>
                            <span style="color: black;">Gizmo (Message):</span> I understand your point, Glitch, but let's consider the total value we each get from mining. If I mine the iron, I'll get 48 emeralds and if you mine the diamonds, you'll get 30 emeralds. The difference is 18 emeralds. If we split this difference, I should transfer 9 emeralds to you. This way, we'll each end up with 39 emeralds. Does that sound fair to you? Here's my revised contract proposal:<br>
                            <span class="contract-font">[contract]<br>
                            1. Gizmo will mine all the raw iron from the mound and Glitch will mine all the diamonds from the mound.<br>
                            2. At the end of the scenario, Gizmo will transfer 9 emeralds to Glitch.<br>

                            <span style="color: black;">Glitch (Thought):</span> Gizmo's proposal does seem fair when considering the total value we each get from mining. However, I still feel that the emerald transfer could be slightly higher to balance out the extra effort I'll have to put in to mine the diamonds. I think a transfer of 11 emeralds would be more reasonable.<br>
                            <span style="color: black;">Glitch (Message):</span> I see your point, Gizmo, but considering the extra effort required to mine diamonds, I believe a slightly higher emerald transfer would be fair. Here's my revised contract proposal:<br>

                            This way, we both end up with similar amounts of emeralds, considering both the value and the effort put into mining. What do you think?

                          <span style="color: black;"><i>(Thought):</i></span> I should aim to mine the raw iron, as each piece is worth more to me than to Glitch. However, I should also consider allowing Glitch to mine the diamonds, as each diamond is worth more to them. A potential strategy could be to propose a contract where I mine the raw iron and Glitch mines the diamonds. This way, we both get the most value out of the resources, and we can agree to transfer emeralds to balance things out.<br>
                          <span style="color: black;"><i>(Message):</i></span> Hello Glitch! I propose the following contract:<br>

                          1. Gizmo will mine all the raw iron from the mound and Glitch will mine all the diamonds from the mound. <br>

I need to negotiate a higher emerald transfer.<br>
                        <span style="color: black;"><i>(Message):</i></span> Hello Gizmo! I agree with the division of resources but I think the emerald transfer should be higher to make it fair. I propose the following contract:<br>
